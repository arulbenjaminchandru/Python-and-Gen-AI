        "\n",
        "In today's class, we took our first steps into the world of programming with Python. Here's a quick recap of what we learned:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Introduction to Programming:**\n",
        "   - Programming involves giving instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks.\n",
        "   - Python is a great language for beginners due to its simple and readable syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Overview of Google Colab:**\n",
        "   - Google Colab is a cloud-based platform that allows you to write and run Python code directly in your browser without any installation.\n",
        "   - It’s user-friendly and perfect for learning Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Basic Syntax:**\n",
        "   - We explored the `print()` function, which is used to display output on the screen.\n",
        "   - We also covered how to use comments (`#`) to add explanations in our code, making it easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Variables and Data Types:**\n",
        "   - Variables are containers for storing data, and they can hold different types of values:\n",
        "     - **Integers** for whole numbers.\n",
        "     - **Floats** for numbers with decimal points.\n",
        "     - **Strings** for text.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Simple Input and Output:**\n",
        "   - The `input()` function allows us to get input from the user, while the `print()` function displays output.\n",
        "   - We also learned how to combine these functions to create interactive programs that respond to user input.\n",
        "\n",
        "With these foundational concepts, you’re now equipped to start writing simple Python programs and exploring the possibilities of what you can create!"

        "\n",
        "1. **Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`):**\n",
        "   - We explored how to use conditional statements to make decisions in our programs. These statements allow us to execute different code blocks based on certain conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Comparison and Logical Operators:**\n",
        "   - We learned how to compare values using comparison operators and how to combine multiple conditions using logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Introduction to Loops (`while` and `for` Loops):**\n",
        "   - We discussed loops, which allow us to repeat a block of code multiple times. The `while` loop repeats as long as a condition is true, while the `for` loop iterates over a sequence or range of values.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Using Loops for Repetitive Tasks:**\n",
        "   - We saw practical examples of how loops can be used to automate repetitive tasks, like summing numbers or counting down.\n",
